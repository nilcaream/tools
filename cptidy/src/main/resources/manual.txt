analyze

- Usage: check if vault (source argument) is properly organized.
- Options: none.
- Implementation details:
-- Works on source paths only.
-- Supports multiple source directories. Each is processed independently.
-- No files are copied, deleted or modified.
-- Tries to build valid target path for each file.
-- Resolves parent directory name based on file creation data attribute.
-- Output:
--- failure - it is not possible to build valid target path for file,
--- all match - target path is valid and it matches file creation date,
--- partial match - target path is valid but it does not match file creation date.

organize

- Usage: move files from work directories (sources) to vault (target); clean-up work.
- Options: fast, delete, move.
- Implementation details:
-- Requires source and target paths.
-- Supports multiple source directories. Each is processed independently.
-- If no-duplicates options is set, no-copies procedure is executed on each source vs. the target.
--- Files are compared by size and content.
--- Only file with size > 1kB are considered.
--- The parent directory, file type and name is not relevant.
--- If source file and target file are not the same file but have same content, source is marked as a duplicate.
--- If duplicate is found, then it is deleted if delete option is set.
--- File content comparison is optimized if fast option is set.
-- Organize procedure is executed on each source vs. the target.
--- Valid target path is built for each source file.
---- If it is not possible to build target path (unknown file type, invalid name, no exif), then file is ignored.
---- If source and target are the same file, then it is logged as ok-location.
---- If source and target have same content, then source is deleted
----- Options used: delete, fast.
---- Otherwise, source is moved to target.
----- Unique target file name is created if target already contains a different file.
----- Options used: move.
-- If no-empty option is set, then no-empty procedure is executed on each source.
--- Each directory is checked and is deleted if any of below conditions are met:
---- Directory does not contain any files or directories.
---- Contains only empty files (zero size) or ignored files.
----- Ignored file list is configured in configuration file though configuration option.
----- Empty and ignored files are deleted only if they are only files in the directory.
--- Options used: delete

no-duplicates with sources and target

- Usage: delete files from work directories (sources) that are already present in vault (target); clean-up work.
- Usage: remove any duplicated files from source if they are present in target; clean-up source.
- Options: fast, delete
- Implementation details:
-- No-copies procedure is executed on each source vs. the target.
--- See implementation details in Organize.
-- If no-empty option is set, then no-empty procedure is executed on each source.
--- See implementation details in Organize.

no-duplicates with sources only

- Usage: delete duplicated files in each work directory (sources) irrespective of their parent directory; clean-up work.
- Options: fast, delete
- Implementation details:
-- No-source-copies procedure is executed on each source.
--- Each regular file of size > 1kB is scanned.
--- Files of the same size are grouped.
--- Each group is divided into subgroups of same content files.
--- Subgroup with most files is chosen. Only one file from such subgroup is retained. Others are deleted.
--- Options used: fast, delete
-- If no-empty option is set, then no-empty procedure is executed on each source.
--- See implementation details in Organize.

no-duplicates with target only

- Usage: delete duplicated files from each organized directory in the vault; clean-up vault.
- Options: fast, delete
- Implementation details:
-- No-target-copies procedure is executed on the target.
--- Each target child directory is scanned individually.
--- Each regular file of size > 1kB is scanned.
--- Files of the same size are grouped.
--- Each file within the group is compared with another. If they are the same, one of the files is deleted.
--- Options used: fast, delete
-- If no-empty option is set, then no-empty procedure is executed on the target.
--- See implementation details in Organize.

reorganize

- Usage: reapply the organizing rules on existing vault; clean-up vault.
- Options: fast, delete, move.
- Implementation details:
-- Works on source paths only.
-- Supports multiple source directories. Each is processed independently.
-- Organize procedure is executed on each source vs. the same source.
--- See implementation details in Organize.
-- If no-empty option is set, then no-empty procedure is executed on the target.
--- See implementation details in Organize.

no-empty

- Usage: delete directories that are empty or contain only empty or ignored files.
- Options: delete.
- Implementation details:
-- Executes no-empty procedure on all source paths and target path (each independently).
--- See implementation details in Organize.

synchronize

- Usage: synchronizes source vault with target vault.
- Options: fast, time, copy.
- Implementation details:
-- Requires a single source and target path.
-- Each file from source is checked if it exists under the same relative path in target.
--- If it exists and have same file attributes, then it is logged as same attributes.
--- If it has same content, then file timestamps are corrected.
---- Source, target or both files attributes can be modified (if file-system supported).
--- Otherwise source is copied to target.

count-zeros

- Usage: counts files that might be corrupted by having large chunks of zeros.
- Options: buffer.
- Implementation details:
-- Works on source paths only.
-- Supports multiple source directories. Each is processed independently.
-- Buffer size is set through buffer option.
-- Can take long time as all files are read.
-- Useful scripts for cptidy log file:
--- grep "EMPTY-BLOCKS" cptidy-20230226-122539.txt | sort -k 6 -nr | head
--- grep "EMPTY-BLOCKS" cptidy-20230226-122539.txt | sort -k 10 -nr | head
